        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Hilton and I love to learn. I am currently learning
            how to use HTML and CSS to gain web development skills. I usually use 
            Python for my coding and I focus on Data Science applications. I am 
            studying ACME at Brigham Young University (Applied And Computational 
            Mathematics Emphasis). This page is a work in progress, but I have links
            to find me on LinkedIn or GitHub and some of my small projects.
        </p>
