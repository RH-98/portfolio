## CS 260 Portfolio

This portfolio is based on a class designed to teach web design (CS 260 at BYU). These websites are not hosted anywhere, but the code is available to peruse! Labs 1-3 were made by following a step-by-step tutorial. The creative projects were also based on a rubric, but I was free to choose my own topic and style. Web design is not my strong suit, but it was extremely useful to get exposed to many different aspects of web development. Some of the useful things I learned from these projects that I still use today:

1. APIs (calling, reading documentation)
2. Database management
3. Code organization (folder structure, git repositories, etc)
4. Visual aspects of design
